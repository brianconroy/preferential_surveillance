# This script processes the raw plague surveillance dataset (1983-2015) from 
# the California Department of Public Health - Vector Borne Disease Section
# The output dataset contains aggregated counts of cases (plague positive 
# sciurids), controls (plague negative sciurids). Specifically, the output
# is a list of the following lists:

# NOTE: The raw surveillance dataset is not publicly accessible due to 
# privacy concerns (relating to property values and the exact locations 
# of plague positive rodents...). This script will only run if the raw
# dataset is locally accessible.

# locs: a list describing the locations at which rodents were sampled for plague
#       over the (rasterized) state of California. Contains the following values:
#         * raster: a raster of the state of CA at the desire resolution of analysis (426 km^2),
#                   whose values are binary indicators for whether the cell was observed by the 
#                   surveillance system
#         * cells: cell ids of the raster which have been sampled by the surveillance system
#         * status: vector of binary values (0, 1) indicating whether each cell in the raster
#                   has been observed
#         * coords: matrix of lat, lon coordinates of the center points of raster cells that 
#                   have been observed
#         * ids: ids of the raster which have been sampled by the surveillance system where 
#                ids are identified after excluding NA values of the raster

# case.data: a list describing case counts (plague positive) over the study area. Contains 
#           the following values:
#         * y: vector of counts of plague positive specimen recovered over the observed 
#              raster cells
#         * x.standardised: design matrix containing an intercept and two columns, the 
#                           first and second principal components of the PRISM dataset
#                           after range and scale standardisation
#         * x: design matrix containing an intercept and two columns, the 
#              first and second principal components of the PRISM dataset
#              (not standardised)
#         * p: equal to the number of covariates plus intercept

# ctrl.data: a list describing control counts (plague negative) over the study area. 
#            Contains the following values:
#         * y: vector of counts of plague negative specimen recovered over the observed 
#              raster cells.
#         * x.standardised: design matrix containing an intercept and two columns, the 
#                           first and second principal components of the PRISM dataset
#                           after range and scale standardisation
#         * x: design matrix containing an intercept and two columns, the 
#              first and second principal components of the PRISM dataset
#              (not standardised)
#         * p: equal to the number of covariates plus intercept

## Load Data --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Load and aggregate the PRISM principal components

# Check the number of grid cells

## Create Processed Dataset -----------------------------------------------------------

# Create the dataset of locations, case and control counts
